Simulation Conditions

1.6 Mach
0.0 (degree) angle of attack
32.92 (m) body length
U.S. Standard Atmosphere (1976)
15760 (m) altitude
216.65 (K) temperature
5.70e+06 Reynolds Number per meter (for optional viscous simulation)

geometry: geometry CAD files

inviscid: inviscid grids

This model was designed with Cart3D to match the near field pressure
signature of the inviscid NASA Concept 25D with Flow Through Nacelle
at 3 body lengths on the centerline.
